1. Market dynamics comparison between short-term and long-term rentals:

Based on the provided data, the short-term rental market in Turin appears to be relatively expensive compared to the long-term rental market. The monthly rate for a one-bedroom apartment in the short-term rental market is $1160, which is significantly higher than the average monthly rent for a one-bedroom apartment in Turin, which is around $800 (according to Numbeo). This suggests that short-term rentals may be pricing out local residents and contributing to housing affordability issues in the area.

On the other hand, the long-term rental market in Turin appears to be more affordable, with an average monthly rent of $800. This is likely due to the fact that long-term rentals are typically signed for a longer period of time, which allows landlords to offer lower prices to attract tenants.

2. Potential impact on housing affordability:

The short-term rental market in Turin may be contributing to housing affordability issues in the area. As mentioned earlier, the monthly rate for a one-bedroom apartment in the short-term rental market is $1160, which is significantly higher than the average monthly rent for a one-bedroom apartment in Turin. This could lead to displacement of local residents, as they may be priced out of their homes by the higher prices of short-term rentals.

Additionally, the short-term rental market may also lead to a decrease in the availability of long-term rentals, as landlords may choose to rent their properties on a short-term basis instead of long-term. This could further exacerbate housing affordability issues in the area.

3. Suggestions for balanced policy approaches:

To address the housing affordability issues caused by the short-term rental market in Turin, policy makers could consider implementing the following policies:

* Implementing a cap on short-term rental prices, to prevent prices from rising too quickly and pricing out local residents.
* Increasing the supply of long-term rentals, by providing incentives for landlords to rent their properties on a long-term basis instead of short-term.
* Implementing a vacation rental tax, to generate revenue for the city and help fund affordable housing initiatives.
* Providing support for local residents who are facing housing affordability issues, such as through subsidies or assistance programs.
4. Recommendations for sustainable tourism and housing market balance:

To promote sustainable tourism and balance the housing market in Turin, policy makers could consider the following recommendations:

* Encouraging the development of affordable housing options, such as through the construction of new housing units or the rehabilitation of existing ones.
