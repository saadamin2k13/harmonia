# Harmonia

Here, we include code for the PeRAG pipeline (as shown in the figure below) that includes two phases:

1. **Verbalization:** The folder "llm_verbalization" contains all the codes for zero-shot, few-shot, and structured verbalization approaches, considering single and multi-variants of verbalization. For verbalization, LLAMA is used as our LLM.
2. **RAG:** The folder "urban-rag" contains the code for RAG implementation. In this phase, we used GEMMA as our LLM. 



**Figure below is a graphical representation of the PeRAG Pipeline.**
